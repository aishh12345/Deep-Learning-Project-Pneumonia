# Deep-Learning-Project-Pneumonia
Instructions to train the model from scratch:
1) For CNN1 Architecture model
   -Open up the CNN1 ipynb notebook in kaggle Notebook and import the necessary libraries as stated in the first cell
   -Import the Pnemonia Dataset in the input tab in kaggle
   -If running locally, will need to download entire dataset from kaggle and run pip install torch
   -Run the entire file and the trained model will be saved in the stated directory and will print out the training and validation accuracy
2) For Resnet Model

Instructions to test the trained model:
1) For CNN1 Architecture model
  -Under the Testing folder open up the Testing file and import it to Kaggle or open up the Google Collab Link
   -Google Collab link has the Testing file and imported Test Dataset
  -Run all the cells and the model will be loaded and can be tested against a test datatset or single images
3) For Resnet Model
