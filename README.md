# Deep-Learning-Project-Pneumonia
## Instructions to train the model from scratch:
1) For CNN1 Architecture model
   1. Open up the CNN1.ipynb notebook in kaggle Notebook and import the necessary libraries as stated in the first cell
   2. Import the Pnemonia Dataset in the input tab in Kaggle
   3. If running locally, will need to download entire dataset from kaggle and run pip install torch
   4. Run the entire file and the trained model will be saved in the stated directory and will print out the training and validation accuracy
2) For CNN2 Architecture model
   1. Open up the CNN2.ipynb notebook in kaggle Notebook and import the necessary libraries as stated in the first cell
   2. Import the Pnemonia Dataset in the input tab in kaggle
   3. If running locally, will need to download entire dataset from kaggle and run pip install torch
   4. Run the entire file and the trained model will be saved in the stated directory and will print out the training and validation accuracy
3) For CNN3 Architecture model
   1. Open up the CNN3.ipynb notebook in kaggle Notebook and import the necessary libraries as stated in the first cell
   2. Import the Pnemonia Dataset in the input tab in kaggle
   3. If running locally, will need to download entire dataset from kaggle and run pip install torch
   4. Run the entire file and the trained model will be saved in the stated directory and will print out the training and validation accuracy
4) For ResNet-50 model
   1. Open up the ResNet.ipynb notebook in kaggle Notebook and import the necessary libraries as stated in the first cell
   2. Import the Pnemonia Dataset in the input tab in kaggle
   3. If running locally, will need to download entire dataset from kaggle and run pip install torch
   4. Run the entire file and the trained model will be saved in the stated directory and will print out the training and validation accuracy
